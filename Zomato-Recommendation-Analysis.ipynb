    "The dataset contains raw information extracted from the Zomato recommendation application. The data is based in `<city>`, India, and covers the period from `<date1>` to `<date2>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to apply three machine learning models: **Random Forest**, **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, and **Naive Bayes**. Initially, we considered using only Random Forest and SVM. However, to avoid a potential analytical stalemate between two complex models, we introduced Naive Bayes as a third model to offer a simpler probabilistic perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach involves a **three-level iteration process**, where we fine-tune each model at every iteration to account for new patterns, insights, or adjustments in the data. Ultimately, we seek to analyze how the Zomato recommendation algorithm aligns with actual user data and preferences, and evaluate which model best captures this relationship. This process can be better viewed with the following table:\n",
