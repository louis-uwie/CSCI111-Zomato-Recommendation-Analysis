    "The dataset contains raw information sourced from the Zomato Recommendation Platform for restaurants based in Pune, India, covering the year 2023. Each row corresponds to a single restaurant entry and includes a variety of attributes such as the restaurant’s name, multiple types of cuisine offered (up to eight slots), its categorized food type, the average cost for two people, the locality within Pune, and the average customer dining rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset provides a foundation for predictive modeling and exploratory analysis, as it blends both categorical (e.g., cuisine types, locality) and numerical (e.g., rating, pricing) data. Through this structure, we can investigate patterns in consumer preferences, identify key factors influencing restaurant ratings, and evaluate the performance of machine learning models like Decision Trees and Mixed Naive Bayes in classifying highly rated restaurants.\n",

    "- The final model we use in this study is the Mixed Naive Bayes (MNB) classifier. This model is a variation of the standard Naive Bayes algorithm that allows us to handle both categorical and continuous features—whic makes it especially well-suited for real-world datasets like Zomato’s, where variables such as cuisine type (categorical) and average price (numerical) coexist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Conclusion**\n",
    "- Generally, through ***Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and both Decision Tree implementations***, you may conclude that certain features—such as Cuisine type, Locality, or Average Price—have a strong influence on whether a restaurant receives high ratings. _Features like 'MISSING' or non-informative columns could be confirmed as noise, negatively affecting model accuracy._\n",
    "- Comparing ***Decision Tree 1 (all features) with Decision Tree 2 (cleaned features)***, you might find that:\n",
    "    - Removing irrelevant or noisy features leads to higher accuracy and simpler tree structures.\n",
    "    - This supports the idea that domain knowledge-based feature pruning improves model performance.\n",
    "- ***Mixed Naive Bayes (MNB) might perform competitively or better on some metrics*** (like precision or recall) compared to Decision Trees, especially in cases where feature independence is mostly true. However, MNB might underperform if features are highly correlated, where Decision Trees can better handle interactions."
