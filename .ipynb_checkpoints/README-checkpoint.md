CSCI 111 is a class that teaches how Artificial Intelligence (AI) think. 
The class first dwells into basic data structures that concern with how AI may approach decision making processes (i.e., Breadth-First-Search, Depth-First-Search, A* Algorithm, etc.). 

Data structures help us understand and visualize easier how "problem solving Agents" think. These are classifications of Agents that have a degree of what they can essentially 'solve' (i.e., Problem-Based Agent, Supervised or Unsupervised Agents, etc.) ...

After understanding solving Agents, we move into the basics of Machine Learning which includes Data Transformation, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), and Clustering. This is where we first try Jupyter in programming a script that uses various models in transforming, manipulating, and analysing datasets.

Lastly, we tackle Logical Agents. This is adding more logic towards what we previously learned as problem solving Agents where we use propositional logic, inferences, and entailment to establish how we can visualize how an Agent might look at a problem (i.e., Truth table, Inference diagrams, Logical statements / sentences, Knowledge Base (KB))
